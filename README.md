## Assignment Questions

1. In the software process model what is the importance of the “Umbrella activity”? Is that releases of the forthcoming versions are possible without appropriate “Umbrella activity”?

2. How agile manifesto are suitable to overcome the weakness of the traditional software models?

3.  When should a modular design be implemented as monolithic software? How can this be accomplished? Is performance the only justification for implementation of monolithic software?

4.  Using a data flow diagram and a processing narrative, describe a computer-based system that has distinct transform flow characteristics. Define flow boundaries and map the DFD into software architecture?
